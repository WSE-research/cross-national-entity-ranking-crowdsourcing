# Generate Data For Crowdsourcing

## 1. Run `generate_files_for_external_scripts.py` from the `scripts` directory

Command example: `python3 generate_files_for_external_scripts.py --outlang=ru --datapath=../data`

This script will produce files in the `data/final-crowdsourcing-experiments/<LANG>` as follows: `categoryname.txt`, where each line of the file represents an entity label.

In addition, it produces a `categoryname.json` file that represents a mapping between a URI and a label within a category.

## 2. Run `generate-tuples-from-multiple-files.sh` from the `external-scripts/Best-Worst-Scaling-Scripts` directory

Sample command: `./generate-tuples-from-multiple-files.sh /full/path/to/multilingual-qa-with-ranking/data/final-crowdsourcing-experiments/<LANG>`

This script will generate you `tuples/categoryname.tuples` files for all the categories present in the specified directory.

## 3. Manually create "Made-up answers" for "Control tasks"

Made-up answers are the honeypots for crowdworkers. They may look close to truth but actually make no sense. For example, given a search topic "Presidents of the USA" the following made-up answers can be created:

* Barack Clinton
* Joseph Bush
* Donald Kennedy

However, something as below isn't good for made up answers:

* Lake "Clinton"
* Bush Show
* The "Donald" Album

This file is used in the next step while creating Control tasks. The control tasks are created as follows:

* 1 entity for this category (most relevant)
* 2 made up answers (entities)
* 1 entity from completely different category (least relevant)

## 4. Use the respective Jupyter Notebook for final data preparation (MTurk or Toloka)


* For `MTurk` (English/German): `notebooks/mturk/mturk-Best-Worst-Scaling-Scripts-generate-experiment-data.ipynb`
* For `Toloka` (Russian): `notebooks/toloka/toloka-prepare-4-tuple.ipynb`


# Run Evaluation on crowdworkers answers

## 1. Convert answers from a crowdsourcing platform into an acceptable format

Example file format here: ./external-scripts/Best-Worst-Scaling-Scripts/example-tuples-annotations.csv

* For `Toloka` (Russian): `notebooks/toloka/merge_toloka_results_4_tuple.ipynb`
* For `MTurk` (English/German): `notebooks/mturk/merge_mturk_results_4_tuple.ipynb`

## 2. Run `SHR-BWS.pl` from the `external-scripts/Best-Worst-Scaling-Scripts` directory

Sample command: `./SHR-BWS.pl /path/to/converted/file.csv`

# Get ranking scores out of crowdworkers answers

## 1. Convert answers from a crowdsourcing platform into an acceptable format

Example file format here: ./external-scripts/Best-Worst-Scaling-Scripts/example-tuples-annotations.csv

* For `Toloka` (Russian): `notebooks/toloka/merge_toloka_results_4_tuple.ipynb`
* For `MTurk` (English/German): `notebooks/mturk/merge_mturk_results_4_tuple.ipynb`

## 2. Run `get-scores-from-BWS-annotations-counting.pl` from the `external-scripts/Best-Worst-Scaling-Scripts` directory

`./get-scores-from-BWS-annotations-counting.pl /path/to/converted/file.csv`
